# BlogspotImageScraper
For /d/ use only

# Usage
Just execute the SwapCaps.exe script. Additional folders will be created based on the sites chosen.

To get add / delete sites, just edit the sites.json file's entries. Name is the name of the site and the folder will use that name.
URL is obvious.

Just be aware that a full blog download will take a long time (Hours) as they usually have a lot of blog entries with 1-2 pictures.
I plan to add threading support to make downloads faster.
